# 🧬 Homology Modeling Pipeline (Intro)

This notebook simulates a basic **homology modeling workflow** by:

- 📥 Downloading a known **template protein structure** from RCSB PDB
- 📂 Uploading your own **target FASTA sequence**
- 🧬 Extracting the template amino acid sequence
- 🔬 Performing a global alignment with your target sequence
- 📊 Visualizing amino acid composition with a bar plot and gradient table
